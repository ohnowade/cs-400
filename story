One day, Congkai was walking on down on the street. Suddenly, he met a man called Wade.
Wade told him that his real name was Congkai, after which Congkai told him, his real name was Wade.
Wade felt happy, and so did Congkai. Wade asked Congkai if he knew why he was happy, and so did Congkai.
Wade said that was because they were the same person, and so did Congkai.
Wade and Congkai became the best of friends. They continued to meet up every day and shared the same interests. They gamed and worked out every day and spent time from morning to night with each other.
